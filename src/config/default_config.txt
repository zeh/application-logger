# CONFIGURATIONS FOR APPLICATION LOGGER
#
# This file contains several configurations used by Application Logger. You can change them at will.
# They will not become active until Application Logger is restarted, however.
#
# If this file is deleted, it will be rewritten with the default values.
#
# All fields follow, with a description of what each of them does.

# Template for the file path in which logs will be saved.
#
# * This is either relative to the executable path, or an absolute path.
#
# * If the file or path doesn't exist, it will be created.
#
# * Some variables are accepted, and replace the file where convenient:
#
#   [[year]] : current year e.g: 2014
#   [[month]] : current month of the year (starting at 1), e.g: 03, 12
#   [[day]] : current day of the month (starting at 1), e.g: 01, 28
#   [[machine]] : current machine name (useful when saving logs to a network drive or shared space of some kind, like dropbox)
#
# Examples:
#   path=appLog.log
#   path=logs\[[year]]_[[month]].log
#   path=c:\logs\app\[[year]]\[[month]]\[[day]].log
#
path=logs\[[year]]_[[month]]_[[machine]].log

# The time, in seconds, that the computer has to be idle for the user to be considered away.
#
# Examples:
#   idleTime=600
#
idleTime=600

# The interval, in seconds, for verifying whether the user is in a new application or document.
#
# Examples:
#   checkInterval=0.5
#   checkInterval=1
#
checkInterval=1

# The maximum number of log entries that can be queued at any time before they are committed to the log file.
# Generally this should be a very high number, since it's more predictable to let it save to the file based on time (maxQueueTime) instead.
#
# Examples:
#   maxQueueEntries=1000
#
maxQueueEntries=1000

# The maximum amount of time that can pass, in seconds, before the current log entries (if any) are committed to the log file.
# This is done so we avoid writing to the disk too frequently.
#
# Examples:
#   maxQueueTime=300
#
maxQueueTime=300
